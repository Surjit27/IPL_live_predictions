IPL Live Prediction Project

The IPL Live Prediction project is designed to simulate and predict the outcomes of an Indian Premier League (IPL) match, providing real-time updates and win probabilities throughout the game. This project leverages historical data and predictive modeling to offer cricket enthusiasts and analysts a detailed and dynamic view of the match as it progresses.

Key Features

The project includes several key features that enhance the understanding and anticipation of match dynamics:

1. Real-time Score Simulation:
   - The project simulates both innings of an IPL match, updating scores, wickets, batsmen scores, and bowler statistics on a ball-by-ball basis.
   - By incorporating random variations in runs scored and wickets taken, it creates realistic cricket scenarios.

2. Win Probability Calculation:
   - Using machine learning models, the project calculates win probabilities for both teams throughout the match.
   - These probabilities are based on current scores, wickets lost, balls bowled, and run rates, providing insights into each team's chances of winning at any point.

3. Comprehensive Match Statistics:
   - Detailed statistics for each inning include overs bowled, team scores, individual batsmen scores, and bowler performance metrics.
   - For the chasing team, metrics such as required run rate and current run rate are also calculated and updated.

4. Visualizations**:
   - The project generates visualizations like line graphs to depict run rates per over and win probabilities for both teams, offering a clear and intuitive understanding of the match's progression.
   - These visual tools help users quickly grasp the key moments and turning points of the game.
